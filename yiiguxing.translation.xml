      <item value="TRUSTED can change when user explicitly connects to an untrusted network in Settings." />
      <item value="Indicates that this network is not a VPN. This capability is set by default and should be explicitly cleared for VPN networks." />
      <item value="Indicates that the user has indicated implicit trust of this network. This generally means it's a sim-selected carrier, a plugged in ethernet, a paired BT device or a wifi the user asked to connect to. Untrusted networks are probably limited to unknown wifi AP. Set by default." />
      <item value="Indicates that this network is available for general use. If this is not set applications should not attempt to communicate on this network. Note that this is simply informative and not enforcement - enforcement is handled via other means. Set by default." />
      <item value="Indicates that this network should be able to reach the internet." />
      <item value="Indicates that this network is unmetered." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach a carrier's Emergency IMS servers or other services, used for network signaling during emergency calls." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach a carrier's XCAP servers, used for configuration and control." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach a carrier's RCS servers, used for Rich Communication Services." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach a carrier's Initial Attach servers." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach a Wi-Fi direct peer." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach the carrier's CBS servers, used for carrier specific services." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach the carrier's IMS servers, used for network registration and signaling." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach the carrier's FOTA portal, used for over the air updates." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach the carrier's DUN or tethering gateway." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach the carrier's SUPL server, used to retrieve GPS information." />
      <item value="Indicates this is a network that has the ability to reach the carrier's MMSC for sending and receiving MMS messages." />
      <item value="Indicates that this network was tested to only provide partial connectivity." />
      <item value="Indicates that traffic that goes through this network is paid by oem. For example, this network can be used by system apps to upload telemetry data." />
      <item value="Indicates that this network is not congested. &lt;p&gt; When a network is congested, applications should defer network traffic that can be done at a later time, such as uploading analytics." />
      <item value="Indicates that this network is available for use by apps, and not a network that is being kept up in the background to facilitate fast network switching." />
      <item value="Indicates that this network is not roaming." />
      <item value="Indicates that this network was found to have a captive portal in place last time it was probed." />
