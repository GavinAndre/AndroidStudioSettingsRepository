      <item value="Registers to receive notifications about changes in the system default network. The callbacks will continue to be called until either the application exits or {@link #unregisterNetworkCallback(NetworkCallback)} is called." />
      <item value="Called when the network the framework connected to for this request changes capabilities but still satisfies the stated need." />
      <item value="Called if no network is found in the timeout time specified in {@link #requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback, int)} call. This callback is not called for the version of {@link #requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, NetworkCallback)} without timeout. When this callback is invoked the associated {@link NetworkRequest} will have already been removed and released, as if {@link #unregisterNetworkCallback(NetworkCallback)} had been called." />
      <item value="Called when the framework has a hard loss of the network or when the graceful failure ends." />
      <item value="Called when the network is about to be disconnected. Often paired with an {@link NetworkCallback#onAvailable} call with the new replacement network for graceful handover. This may not be called if we have a hard loss (loss without warning). This may be followed by either a {@link NetworkCallback#onLost} call or a {@link NetworkCallback#onAvailable} call for this network depending on whether we lose or regain it." />
      <item value="Called when the framework connects and has declared a new network ready for use. This callback may be called more than once if the {@link Network} that is satisfying the request changes. This will always immediately be followed by a call to {@link #onCapabilitiesChanged(Network, NetworkCapabilities)} then by a call to {@link #onLinkPropertiesChanged(Network, LinkProperties)}." />
      <item value="Called when the framework connects and has declared a new network ready for use. This callback may be called more than once if the {@link Network} that is satisfying the request changes." />
      <item value="Called when the framework connects to a new network to evaluate whether it satisfies this request. If evaluation succeeds, this callback may be followed by an {@link #onAvailable} callback. There is no guarantee that this new network will satisfy any requests, or that the network will stay connected for longer than the time necessary to evaluate it." />
      <item value="Base class for {@code NetworkRequest} callbacks. Used for notifications about network changes. Should be extended by applications wanting notifications." />
      <item value="快速" />
      <item value="Reports calls to java.lang.Thread.sleep() that occur inside loops. Such calls are indicative of &quot;busy-waiting&quot;. Busy-waiting is often inefficient, and may result in unexpected deadlocks as busy-waiting threads do not release locked resources." />
